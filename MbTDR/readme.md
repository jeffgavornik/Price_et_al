# MbTDR

Data to fit the statistical model, MbTDR. This takes quite a while to run and was done on Boston University's shared computing cluster (SCC).  

If you would like to use this model on your own data, we recommend using the original repo from the Aoi, Mante, & Pillow paper: https://github.com/pillowlab/mTDRdemo .
