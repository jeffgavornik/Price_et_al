# Stimulus 

The primary file in this folder, SeqRFExp.m, was used to generate visual stimuli in our experiments. This was used in conjunction with Psychtoolbox3 and an interface to a DAQ USB-1208FS-Plus that communicated synchronization signals to the OpenEphys recording equipment that we used to do electrophysiology.
