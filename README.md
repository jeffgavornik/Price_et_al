# Price_et_al
Analysis code used in Price et al. 2022

## Data Download
Data from the paper (necessary to run the code) can be found in MATLAB format at ... (NWB format forthcoming)

## Example Script
Download the data and this repository. Run "RunStatAnalyses.m" from FigureStats folder to create dot plots and run permutation tests from the paper.

## Model-based targeted dimensionality reduction (MbTDR)
MbTDR folder contains code to fit the MbTDR model, but we highly recommend using code from the original paper by Mikio Aoi and Jonathan Pillow: https://github.com/pillowlab/mTDRdemo

Decoding folder contains code to perform decoding analyses, given the MbTDR fit.
